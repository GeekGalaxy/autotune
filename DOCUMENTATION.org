* Introduction

Acksin STRUM is the tool to diagnose Linux issues quickly. It gives
you a complete picture of the CPU, Memory, IO, Networking, Processes,
Kernel Limits, etc. of a system. STRUM was born out of the frustration
that diagnosing an issue was to go through a mental checklist and
dealing with fallible human memory (especially at 3am when the pager
goes off). We hope that this tool will help.
