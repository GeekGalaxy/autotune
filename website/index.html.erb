        <h3>What is STRUM?</h3>

        <p>
          STRUM is the tool to diagnose Linux issues quickly. It won't
          give you everything but it tells you what to look at closer.
        </p>

        <p>
          STRUM was created to create a checklist like diagnostic
          system. Waking up at 3am to a Pager and drowsily tying ten
          commands to figure out what is wrong may lead to issues that
          are not diagnosed.

        <h3>FAQ</h3>

        <dl>
        <dt>How does STRUM gather data?</dt>
        <dd>
          STRUM uses the Linux system's <code>/proc</code> file system
          to gather data. However, traversing /proc and understanding
          the jargon is quite a hurdle. So we have created a tool to
          traverse the file system and give you the relevant
          diagnostics.
        </dd>
        <dt>Are other Unicies supported?</dt>
        <dd>
          Currently we only support Linux but we wish to add the BSDs
          and Mac OS X in the future.
