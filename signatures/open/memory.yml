procfs:
  vm.swappiness:
    value: "0"
    description: |
      Disable swapping and clear the file system page cache to free memory first.
  proc.min_free_kbytes:
    value: "65536"
    description: |
      Amount of memory to keep free. Don't want to make this too high
      as Linux will spend more time trying to reclaim memory.


sysfs:
  "/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled":
    value: "always"
    description: |
      Explit huge page usage making the page size of 2 or 4 MB instead
      of 4kb. Should reduce CPU overhead and improve MMU page
      translation.
