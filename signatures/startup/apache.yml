    description: |
      Since 2.6.32 Linux kernel is using the Completely Fair Scheduler
      but in a machine running forked processes you may run into
      problems. This parameter determines how long a migrated process
      has to be running before the kernel will consider migrating it
      again to another core. Apache scales much higher if this number
      is higher.
